March 29 - April 11

During this time the team worked primarly on research. While we had discussed bots in class and the group members all had some familiarity with traditional web development as with websites, none of the team members were familiar with creating chrome extensions. 

We took this time to learn more about chrome extension specifically and see what differences, if any, existed between what we were familiar with and the new material to make developing the bot easier.

As for our reflection at the end, we were a little nervous at having alloted so much time to getting familiar with the unfamiliar code. However we were all confident that we would be able to accomplish a minimual proof of concept by the end of the next sprint.

April 12 - April 25

During this time we discussed the basic components of the application and worked out who would be given what work. The work breakdown as discussed between group members looked like this:
  Gabriela
- Music/Noise Technique
- Pomodoro Technique

  Erick
- Reminders

  Steven
- Encouragement Techique

  All
- CSS
- Main Menu

We wrote up these general ideas on our project board. However, we did not turn them into issues as it was clearly understood between group members who was doing what. Thus they weren't turned into issues and officially assigned until much later.
At the end of this last sprint we were able to accomplish the following tasks:

AS one can see by the end of Sprint 2, we were able to finish each use-case functionality that was set out to be done, with the exception of the pomodoro tequnique which will be implemented in the polishing before the final submission. The polishing of adding css and more JS to the bot in order to make the user interface much cleaner will be implemented in the polishing before the final submission. Looking back, We could have set out to have better management in our time and github use, as we ended up taking more time in just getting the bot off the ground as we would of liked, delaying the implementation of the use-cases. Overall, we feel that the team is in a good spot to present a demo in a week and have a polished version of the bot in the next two weeks.
